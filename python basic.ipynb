    "1.What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
    "-Python is a high-level, easy-to-read programming language used for web development, data analysis, AI, and more.\n",
    "Its popularity comes from its simplicity, vast libraries, and strong community support.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
    "-An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, converting the high-level instructions you write (in .py files) into machine-level instructions that the computer can understand and execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
    "-Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and are part of the Python language syntax. These words cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, function names, or class names) because they are used to define the structure and flow of Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
    "-No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.What is mutability in Python ?\n",
    "- Mutability in Python refers to whether or not an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
    "Mutable objects:List,dict,set\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    "-In Python, lists are mutable and tuples are immutable because of intentional design decisions based on their intended use cases and performance considerations.\n",
    "tuples are mutable\n",
    "Designed for change: Lists are meant to store collections of items that can be modified—like adding, removing, or changing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use case: When working with data that may change over time (e.g., appending user inputs, sorting data), mutability is helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: Lists in Python use dynamic arrays under the hood, allowing in-place modification without needing to reallocate memory constantly.\n",
    "tuples are imutable\n",
    "Designed for fixed data: Tuples are meant to represent fixed collections of values—like coordinates, RGB color values, or function return groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Safer and hashable: Since they can’t be changed, tuples can be used as dictionary keys or stored in sets (if they contain only hashable elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization: Because they’re immutable, Python can optimize memory and performance for tuples more aggressively than for lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
    "-In Python, == and is are both comparison operators, but they serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. == (Equality Operator)\n",
    "Checks if the values of two variables are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It compares the contents of the variables.\n",

    "8.What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
    "-Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements (expressions that evaluate to True or False). They are primarily used in control flow statements like if, while, etc.\n",
    "there are 3 operator in python and,or,not.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
    "-Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is often necessary when you need to perform operations involving different data types or when you need to ensure a specific type of data format for an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of type casting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit Type Casting (Type Coercion): This occurs automatically when Python converts one data type to another without the programmer's intervention. It usually happens wh\n",
    "\n",
    "11.en you perform operations with mixed data types. For example, if you add an integer and a float, Python automatically converts the integer to a float before performing the operation.\n",
    "Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is often necessary when you need to perform operations involving different data types or when you need to ensure a specific type of data format for an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit Type Casting: This is when you manually convert a variable from one data type to another using Python's built-in functions. You use specific functions like int(), float(), str(), etc., to explicitly cast between types.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting  ?\n",
    "-The difference between implicit and explicit type casting (also called type conversion) in programming lies in how the conversion between data types is handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Type Conversion):\n",
    "This is automatically done by the compiler without the programmer’s intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "It happens when the data type of a variable can be automatically converted to a wider or compatible type without loss of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "No explicit syntax is needed; the compiler decides when the conversion is safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically happens when converting smaller data types\n",
    " Explicit Type Casting (Manual Type Conversion):\n",
    "This requires the programmer's explicit intervention to convert one data type to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used when the conversion is not automatically possible or when the programmer wants to force the conversion, even if it may cause loss of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most languages, explicit casting is done using casting operators or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
    "- Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow you to execute specific blocks of code only if a given condition is true or false. This is essential for making decisions in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main types of conditional statements in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "if statement: This runs a block of code if the condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Execute this block if condition is True\n",
    "elif (else if) statement: This allows you to check multiple conditions. If the initial if condition is false, it checks additional conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # Execute if condition1 is True\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # Execute if condition2 is True\n",
    "else statement: This runs a block of code if all previous conditions are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Execute if condition is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Execute if condition is False\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "age = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If age is 18 or more, it prints \"You are an adult.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If age is less than 18, it prints \"You are a minor.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "Decision-making: Conditional statements enable programs to make decisions based on inputs, user choices, or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: They allow different paths of execution, depending on the state of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow: Helps structure the flow of execution in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are crucial for handling scenarios where different outcomes are required under varying conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.How does the elif statement work ?\n",
    "-The elif statement in Python is short for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions in a sequence. It comes after an if statement and before an optional else statement.he elif allows you to check for multiple conditions without nesting multiple if statements, making the code cleaner and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
    "-The main difference between for and while loops lies in how they control the flow of iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop is generally used when the number of iterations is known beforehand or is based on a sequence (like a list, range, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a definite start, condition, and increment/decrement step built into its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "for i in range(5):  # loops through values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "While Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. It continues running as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition is checked before each iteration, and the loop runs until the condition becomes false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 5:  # loop runs as long as i is less than 5\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1  # increment i after each iteration\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "For loop is more compact and used when the number of iterations is known or the loop iterates over a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "While loop is more flexible and is used when you don’t know the number of iterations ahead of time but want to loop as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "-A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you don’t know in advance how many iterations you’ll need, or when you want the loop to continue based on a condition that may change dynamically during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are building a program that asks a user to input their password repeatedly until they enter the correct one. In this case, you don’t know how many attempts the user will need, so a while loop would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "correct_password = \"secure123\"\n",
    "user_input = \"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "while user_input != correct_password:\n",
    "    user_input = input(\"Please enter your password: \")\n",
    "    if user_input != correct_password:\n",
    "        print(\"Incorrect password, try again.\")\n",
    "In this example, the loop continues indefinitely (or until the user enters the correct password) without a predefined number of iterations, which makes the while loop ideal for the situation.\n",
